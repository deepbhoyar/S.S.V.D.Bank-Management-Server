# S.S.V.D.Bank-Management-Server
Hello, This is my very first core python and sql connector project.
Basics of python commands such as def, class , object , if else elif statements and print menu options are used on the jupyter notebook.
An SQL connection is formed where 2 tables are created to store the data entered by the customer in the bank database.
